## Coding Exercise

  __Task 1__  Implement JSON API endpoints

    # Routes
      - Get all routes
      - Get a route by id
      - CRUD operation on a route
      - Bonus: CRUD operation on a specific way point id

    And one of the following:

      # Stations
        - Get all stations
        - Get a station by id
        - CRUD operation on a station
        - Custom end point: Return all stations within a given radius from a given latitude and longitude (eg show all stations within 20000m from <-37.5,-122.0>)
      
      or:

      # Drones
        - Get all drones
        - Get a drone by id
        - CRUD operation on a drone
        - Custom end point: Return timeseries data for what route each drone is on


  __Task 2__   Tests

      # Unit tests
      # Bonus: end 2 end tests

__Bonus:__

    # Use docker (or any containerization technologies) for the API and database.
    # You can use any framework, language, and database you are most comfortable with.
    # Documentation is important.
    # Don't worry about not having enough time. Try to complete as many task as you can.
    # Return all stations that are within a given distance from a specific route.
